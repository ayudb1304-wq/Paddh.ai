### 1.3 Database Schema Design ✅
Created comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with Prisma ORM supporting:

**Exam Types**: UPSC, JEE, NEET (enum)

**Core Models**:
- `User` - User accounts with Clerk integration
  - Subscription tier (FREE/CORE_PASS)
  - Relations to all user-generated content

- `Exam` - Exam configurations (UPSC/JEE/NEET)
  - Pre-seeded with exam metadata

- `Subject` - Subjects within each exam
  - Weightage for priority
  - Relations to topics and flashcards

- `Topic` - Topics within subjects
  - Granular organization of content

- `StudyPlan` - User study plans
  - Target date, hours per day
  - Exam-specific configuration

- `Flashcard` - Spaced repetition cards
  - Question/Answer content
  - SRS metadata (easeFactor, interval, repetitions)
  - Next review date
  - Source tracking (manual/AI-generated)

- `Review` - Review history
  - Quality rating (0-5 for SM-2)
  - Time spent tracking

- `QuizAttempt` - Quiz results
  - Score, total cards, time spent

- `JournalEntry` - Daily journal entries
  - Content and optional mood tracking

- `Streak` - Streak tracking
  - Current and longest streaks
  - Last active date

- `Subscription` - Payment records

**Database Indexes**: Optimized for common queries (userId, examId, nextReview, etc.)

### 1.4 Seed Data ✅
Created comprehensive seed data for all three exams:

**UPSC (7 subjects, 20+ topics)**:
- History (Ancient, Medieval, Modern, World)
- Geography (Physical, Indian, World)

## ✅ Phase 2: Authentication & Core Features (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)

### 2.1 Clerk Authentication Integration ✅ (Completed Oct 11, 2025)
**Status**: Complete ✅

**Implementation Details**:
1. ✅ Installed `@clerk/nextjs` package
2. ✅ Configured environment variables:

   - Uses `clerkMiddleware()` and `createRouteMatcher()`
   - Public routes: `/`, `/sign-in(.*)`, `/sign-up(.*)`
   - All other routes protected with `auth.protect()`

4. ✅ Wrapped app with `<ClerkProvider>` in `app/layout.tsx`

5. ✅ Created custom-branded authentication pages:
   - **Sign-In Page**: `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`
     - Aurora background animation
     - Custom Clerk component styling matching brand colors
     - Link to sign-up page
   - **Sign-Up Page**: `app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`
     - Matching design system
     - Link to sign-in page

6. ✅ Built protected dashboard:
   - **Server Component**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
     - Uses `currentUser()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
     - Redirects unauthenticated users

**Authentication Flow**:
- User clicks "Get Started" → redirected to `/dashboard`
- Middleware detects unauthenticated user → redirects to `/sign-in`
- After sign in → automatically redirected to `/dashboard`
- Dashboard displays personalized content with user's name
