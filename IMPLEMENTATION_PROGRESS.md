```

### 1.3 Database Schema Design ✅
Created comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with Prisma ORM supporting:

**Exam Types**: UPSC, JEE, NEET (enum)

**Core Models**:
- `User` - User accounts with Clerk integration
  - Subscription tier (FREE/CORE_PASS)
  - Relations to all user-generated content

- `Exam` - Exam configurations (UPSC/JEE/NEET)
  - Pre-seeded with exam metadata

- `Subject` - Subjects within each exam
  - Weightage for priority
  - Relations to topics and flashcards

- `Topic` - Topics within subjects
  - Granular organization of content

- `StudyPlan` - User study plans
  - Target date, hours per day
  - Exam-specific configuration

- `Flashcard` - Spaced repetition cards
  - Question/Answer content
  - SRS metadata (easeFactor, interval, repetitions)
  - Next review date
  - Source tracking (manual/AI-generated)

- `Review` - Review history
  - Quality rating (0-5 for SM-2)
  - Time spent tracking

- `QuizAttempt` - Quiz results
  - Score, total cards, time spent

- `JournalEntry` - Daily journal entries
  - Content and optional mood tracking

- `Streak` - Streak tracking
  - Current and longest streaks
  - Last active date

- `Subscription` - Payment records
  - Razorpay integration fields
  - Subscription period tracking

**Database Indexes**: Optimized for common queries (userId, examId, nextReview, etc.)

### 1.4 Seed Data ✅
Created comprehensive seed data for all three exams:

**UPSC (7 subjects, 20+ topics)**:
- History (Ancient, Medieval, Modern, World)
- Geography (Physical, Indian, World)
- Polity (Constitution, Government, Local Governance)
- Economy (Planning, Development, Current Issues)
- Environment & Ecology
- Science & Technology
- Current Affairs

**JEE (3 subjects, 13+ topics)**:
- Physics (Mechanics, Thermodynamics, EM, Optics, Modern)
- Chemistry (Physical, Organic, Inorganic)
- Mathematics (Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Trigonometry, Vectors)

**NEET (3 subjects, 12+ topics)**:
- Physics (Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electrostatics, Optics)
- Chemistry (Physical, Organic, Inorganic)
- Biology (Diversity, Plant Physiology, Human Physiology, Genetics, Ecology)

### 1.5 Algorithms Implementation ✅
**SM-2 (SuperMemo 2) Algorithm**:
- Standard spaced repetition implementation
- Quality ratings: 0-5
- Automatic ease factor adjustment
- Interval calculation (1 day → 6 days → exponential)
- Next review date scheduling

**AI-Optimized SRS** (for Core Pass):
- Extends SM-2 with personalization
- Adjusts intervals based on:
  - Average quality score (user performance)
  - Recent accuracy (last 20 reviews)
- Multipliers: 0.7x (struggling) to 1.3x (excelling)
- Adaptive difficulty for optimal retention

### 1.6 Landing Page ✅
Migrated and enhanced landing page with:
- Hero section with clear value proposition
- Target audience cards (UPSC/JEE/NEET)
- Feature showcase (6 features with free/premium tags)
- Pricing section (Free vs. Core Pass)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Branded color palette:
  - Background: `#d8e2dc`
  - Light Accent: `#ffe5d9`
  - Pink Accent: `#ffcad4`
  - Strong Pink: `#f4acb7`
  - Text/Dark: `#9d8189` and `#4a4a4a`

### 1.7 Development Environment ✅
- [x] Next.js dev server running on http://localhost:3000
- [x] Hot module replacement working
- [x] Tailwind CSS compilation successful
- [x] Environment variables template created
- [x] Git repository initialized
- [x] README with setup instructions
