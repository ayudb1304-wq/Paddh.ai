## Next Phase: Core Functionality Implementation

### Priority 1: Multi-Exam Onboarding System (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Objective:** Allow users to select their target exam and generate personalized study plans

#### Tasks:
1. **Create Exam Selection Page** (`/onboarding/exam-selection`)
   - Card-based UI for UPSC, JEE, NEET selection
   - Display exam-specific information (dates, subjects, difficulty)
   - Store selection in database (Supabase/PostgreSQL)

2. **Target Date & Current Level Assessment**
   - Calendar picker for exam target date
   - Self-assessment questionnaire (Current preparation level: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
   - Time availability per day (hours)
   - Store user profile data

3. **Generate AI Study Plan**
   - Create day-by-day study schedule based on:
     - Time until exam
     - Daily availability
     - Current level
     - Exam syllabus (predefined for each exam)
   - Use OpenAI API to generate personalized recommendations
   - Display plan in calendar/timeline view

4. **Database Schema Setup**
   ```sql
   -- Users table extension
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN selected_exam VARCHAR(20);
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN exam_date DATE;
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN daily_study_hours INTEGER;
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN preparation_level VARCHAR(20);

   -- Study plans table
   CREATE TABLE study_plans (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     exam_type VARCHAR(20),
     start_date DATE,
     end_date DATE,
     daily_tasks JSONB,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

### Priority 2: Flashcard System (CORE FEATURE)
**Objective:** Allow users to create, review, and manage flashcards with SRS algorithm

#### Tasks:
1. **Create Flashcard Page** (`/dashboard/flashcards`)
   - List view of all flashcards (filterable by subject/topic)
   - Search functionality
   - Stats: Total cards, Due today, Mastered, Learning

2. **Manual Flashcard Creation**
   - Simple form: Front (question) + Back (answer)
   - Optional: Add tags, subject, difficulty level
   - Rich text editor support (markdown or WYSIWYG)

3. **Spaced Repetition Algorithm (SRS)**
   - Implement SM-2 algorithm (SuperMemo 2)
   - Track: ease factor, interval, repetitions, next review date
   - Database schema:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE flashcards (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     front TEXT NOT NULL,
     back TEXT NOT NULL,
     tags TEXT[],
     subject VARCHAR(100),
     ease_factor DECIMAL DEFAULT 2.5,
     interval INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
     repetitions INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     next_review_date TIMESTAMP,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   CREATE TABLE review_sessions (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     flashcard_id UUID REFERENCES flashcards(id),
     quality INTEGER, -- 0-5 rating
     reviewed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

4. **Review Interface**
   - Show flashcard front
   - "Show Answer" button reveals back
   - Self-grade buttons: Again, Hard, Good, Easy
   - Update SRS values based on rating
   - Track daily review streak

---

### Priority 3: AI Flashcard Generator (Premium Feature)
**Objective:** Auto-generate flashcards from uploaded PDFs/text using AI

#### Tasks:
1. **File Upload Interface**
   - PDF upload functionality
   - Text paste area
   - File size limits (e.g., 10MB)

2. **AI Processing Pipeline**
   - Extract text from PDF (use pdf-parse or similar)
   - Send to OpenAI API with prompt:
     ```
     "Extract key concepts from this text and create question-answer flashcard pairs.
     Format as JSON array: [{front: 'question', back: 'answer'}]"
     ```
   - Parse AI response and create flashcards in bulk

3. **Review & Edit Generated Cards**
   - Show all generated cards in preview
   - Allow user to edit/delete before saving
   - Bulk actions: Select all, Delete selected, Save all

4. **Database Integration**
   - Store generated cards with metadata (source: 'AI', uploaded_file_name)
   - Link to user's study plan if applicable

---

### Priority 4: Analytics & Progress Tracking
**Objective:** Visualize user's study progress and retention rates

#### Tasks:
1. **Dashboard Stats**
   - Cards reviewed today/this week
   - Review streak (consecutive days)
   - Retention rate (% of cards remembered)
   - Time spent studying

2. **Charts & Visualizations**
   - Line chart: Reviews over time
   - Bar chart: Cards by subject/topic
   - Pie chart: Card distribution (New, Learning, Mastered)
   - Heatmap: Study activity calendar

3. **Subject-Level Analytics**
   - Breakdown by subject (e.g., Polity, History for UPSC)
   - Identify weak areas (low retention subjects)
   - Suggest focused review sessions

### Priority 5: Metacognitive Journal (Unique Feature)
**Objective:** Help users reflect on their learning process

#### Tasks:
1. **Daily Journal Prompts**
   - "What did you learn today?"
   - "What was challenging?"
   - "What study strategies worked well?"
   - Optional daily notes with rich text

2. **Streak & Habit Building**
   - Track consecutive days of journaling
   - Gamification: Badges for 7-day, 30-day, 100-day streaks
   - Motivational quotes/tips

3. **Review Past Entries**
