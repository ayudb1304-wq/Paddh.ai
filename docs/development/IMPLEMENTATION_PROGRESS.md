  - Weightage for priority
  - Relations to topics and flashcards

- `Topic` - Topics within subjects
  - Granular organization of content

- `StudyPlan` - User study plans
  - Target date, hours per day
  - Exam-specific configuration

- `Flashcard` - Spaced repetition cards
  - Question/Answer content
  - SRS metadata (easeFactor, interval, repetitions)
  - Next review date
  - Source tracking (manual/AI-generated)

- `Review` - Review history
  - Quality rating (0-5 for SM-2)
  - Time spent tracking
