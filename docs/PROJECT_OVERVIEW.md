## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Single Next.js app handles both frontend and backend (API routes)
   - Faster MVP development
   - Easy to split into microservices later if needed

2. **PostgreSQL + Prisma**: Relational database with type-safe ORM
   - Strong data relationships (exams → subjects → topics)
   - Type safety end-to-end
   - Easy migrations

3. **Clerk for Auth**: Managed authentication service
   - No need to build auth from scratch
   - Built-in user management
   - OAuth providers ready

4. **Multi-Exam from Day 1**: Schema designed to support all three exams
   - Polymorphic design with `examId` references
   - Exam-specific logic in business layer
   - Scalable to add more exams later

5. **Freemium Model**: Clear separation of free vs. premium features
   - Free tier is fully functional (builds habit)
   - Premium tier adds efficiency (AI features)
   - Database schema supports subscription tiers
